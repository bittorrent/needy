`needy` is tool that aims to make library dependencies as magical as possible. Dependencies are declared in a file called "needs.json", usually by simply adding a download URL and checksum. Then `needy` will download and build those dependencies for you, for iOS, Android, or your host system.

It's in pretty early stages though, so expect bugs and incomplete features.
